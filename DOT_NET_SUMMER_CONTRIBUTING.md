# Welcome

Welcome to #dotnetsummer with Keen.IO, and thanks for participating. To start, please read the normal [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

From there, head over to the Keen IO Community [Slack Team](http://keen.chat) and find the #dotnetsummer channel. Feel free to introduce yourself and maybe talk about what your experience level is and what you'd like to get out of this #dotnetsummer sprint. You can use this Slack channel to ask questions and get help related to the Keen.IO .NET SDK.

# Get to Work

## Pick something to work on

We've created a label (`#dotnetsummer`) for Issues we think would be good to tackle in this sprint. Take a look at open [Issues](https://github.com/keenlabs/keen-sdk-net/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%23dotnetsummer) with that label to get an idea of what sorts of things you could work on.

There are some Projects we've created to track work, so browse [those](https://github.com/keenlabs/keen-sdk-net/projects) to get a feel for the types of things you could work on. If something doesn't have the `#dotnetsummer` label, that might be fine, or if something you'd like to see done isn't listed in any Issue or Project, feel free to bring it up in the Slack channel.

If you see something you'd like to work on, head over to the Slack channel and make sure it's OK to start work on that--mostly to just not duplicate effort in case someone else already had their eye on that Issue.

Issues could potentially be assigned to Github users, and can be broken up into finer-grained Issues if it turns out the work is more substantial that we'd initially imagine. The goal is to get lots of people involved by divvying up manageable chunks of work. So we're ready to be flexible and help manage that work.

## Do the work

Follow the advice in the general contribution guide and go through the normal motions. We've created a `dotnetsummer` branch that we'd like to be the long-running branch for work done as part of this sprint:
  * Fork the repo
  * Clone
  * Switch to the `dotnetsummer` branch
  * Create a branch for the Issue you're tackling off this branch
  * Code, test, code, test
  * Rebase if you haven't pushed, or merge `dotnetsummer` into your branch to get up-to-date
  * Squash or otherwise clean up your code
  * Now that your bug is fixed or feature is implemented and tested, create your Pull Request
  * Wait for feedback, and address it as requested
  * ??
  * Profit!

## Feel good about yourself!

You contributed to an Open Source project and hopefully learned something along the way. We bet you taught us some stuff too!
